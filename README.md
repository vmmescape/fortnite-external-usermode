# Fortnite Usermode ( External )  
A decent Fortnite external designed for educational and research purposes ( It was made in 5 hours so don't expect it to be perfect ).   

This repo demonstrates basic usermode interaction with the game and how can it be structured cleanly.  

Made this public as Iâ€™m quitting, so feel free to use or learn from it.

It's not updated to the latest game version nor have a ready-to-use driver
